# reasonml-todo

This is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


## setup
```
yarn add --dev bs-platform bs-jest reason-react
yarn add bs-platform reason-scripts
```

## issues
It seems strange that the code does not build.
Have to check [reason-react](https://github.com/reasonml-community/reason-react-example)
